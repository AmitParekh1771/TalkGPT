# TalkGPT:
Voice based authentication and play with ChatGPT using voice commands.

A user can signup by giving his voice samples that are used to authenticate him in the future. On login, a user have to read a random generated code in his voice to get authenticated.

Once the user is authenticated using his voice, he can talk to a voice assistant at the click of a button and literally ask him anything. The assistant can also be used to navigate throughout the website without touching the mouse and keyboard, just by your voice.

# How to run:

Start the python flask server for voice authentication using:
python app.py

Start the node.js express server for talking to assistant using:
npm run dev
